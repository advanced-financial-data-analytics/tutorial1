# Asset Returns Tutorial

The goal  of this tutorial is to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of asset returns in financial analysis using R. You'll learn how to calculate, analyze, and interpret different types of financial returns while building practical skills in R programming and data visualization.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:
- Calculate and interpret simple and logarithmic returns
- Analyze the statistical properties of financial returns
- Create basic portfolio return calculations
- Visualize and interpret financial time series data

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have:
- Basic knowledge of R programming
- Understanding of basic statistical concepts
- Access to Posit Cloud

## Getting Started

1. Run `setup.R` to install required packages
2. Run `load_data.R` to ensure data is available
3. Open `intro_to_toolkiit.qmd` to begin the tutorial

The data loading script will:
- Create a data directory if needed
- Download/create data if not present
- Load the data into your environment

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Access Posit Cloud**
   - Navigate to the course Posit Cloud space (See Canvas Announcements for details)
   - Create a new project

2. **Install Required Packages**
   - Open the `setup.R` script
   - Run the script to install and load all necessary packages
   - This will install: tidyverse, moments, tseries, knitr, and rmarkdown

### Working with the Tutorial

The tutorial consists of several key files:
- `intro_to_toolkiit.qmd`: Main tutorial document with exercises
- `fin7028_dat.RData`: Financial dataset for analysis
- `setup.R`: Script for installing required packages

## Working Through the Tutorial

1. Start by running `setup.R` to ensure all required packages are installed
2. Open `intro_to_toolkiit.qmd` in Posit Cloud
3. Work through the exercises sequentially
4. Render the document to see your results

## Key Concepts Covered

- Simple vs. logarithmic returns
- Multi-period returns
- Portfolio returns
- Excess returns and performance metrics
- Statistical properties of returns
- Volatility analysis

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the error messages in R
2. Review the relevant section in the tutorial
3. Consult the course discussion forum
4. Contact the course teaching team

## Additional Resources

- Course textbook chapters on asset returns
- R documentation for financial packages
- Additional reading materials on Canvas

## Submission Guidelines

- Complete all exercises in the tutorial
- Ensure your code runs without errors
- Include clear explanations for your analysis
- Follow good coding practices and documentation

## Note on Data

The financial data used in this tutorial (`fin7028_dat.RData`) contains daily stock prices and returns. Please ensure you handle the data appropriately and be aware of any missing values or other data quality issues.
